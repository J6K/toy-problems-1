# Sudoku Checker

Given a full sudoku board, return 'solved' if the board is solved, or 'invalid' if the board is invalid.

A sudoku board is solved if each column, row, and 3 x 3 subgrid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

The input will be a single string with `\n` (newline) characters to denote rows.
