# Toy Problems

This is a collection of toy problems, good for keeping your mind sharp and practice being mindful of algorithmic thinking, time complexity, memory consumption, and more.

## File Structure

Each toy problem is given a directory, and each directory has a prompt markdown file and a .js file that contains the solution.

## Misc.

The prompts are typically taken from Codewars, Coderbyte (free), or Leetcode. If you want to discuss, feel free to tweet me! [@kanadachi](https://twitter.com/kan_adachi)
