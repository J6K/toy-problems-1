# Sum lists

Given 2 linked lists that both represent a number:

```
7 -> 1 -> 6 = 753
5 -> 9 -> 2 = 295
```

Output the sum of the lists as a linked list:

```
2 -> 1 -> 9 (912)
```

## Follow up:

Sppose the digits are stored in forward order and the answer is also expected to be in forward order. Repeat the problem.
